# Metacritic-Video-Game-Web-Scraper

Web Scraper for metacritic.com coded in Python which produces a csv file
that contains video game information such as video game titles,
genres, platforms, developers, release date, and metascore given to each game. 

The file "metacritic(example).csv" is a small part of what the webscraper would produce if ran.
